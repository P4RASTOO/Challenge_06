# Challenge_06 Report
## Overview of the Analysis:
In this project, we assume the role of an analyst at a proptech company aiming to provide an instant, one-click service for people to buy and rent properties. The trial of this service is focused on the San Francisco real estate market. Our task is to use data visualization skills, including aggregation, interactive visualizations, and geospatial analysis, to identify viable investment opportunities in the San Francisco housing rental market. We create a Jupyter notebook to analyze housing data and develop interactive visualizations using hvPlot and GeoViews.

## Methods Used:
1) Calculate and Plot the Housing Units per Year:
Group and aggregate data by year, then visualize the results as a bar chart to identify trends in housing units over the analyzed period.

2) Calculate and Plot the Average Sale Prices per Square Foot: Group data by year, calculate the average price per square foot, and visualize it as a line plot. Identify years with decreased average sale prices and their impact on gross rent.

3) Compare the Average Sale Prices by Neighborhood: Create a DataFrame that groups data by year and neighborhood, calculate the average sale price per square foot, and gross rent. Use an interactive line plot to compare sale prices and gross rents in different neighborhoods. Analyze changes in Anza Vista neighborhood from 2012 to 2016.

4) Build an Interactive Neighborhood Map: Read neighborhood coordinates data, create DataFrames for neighborhood information, and visualize the data using an interactive map. Identify neighborhoods with the highest gross rent and sale price per square foot.

5) Compose Your Data Story: Summarize trends in rental income growth and sales prices across neighborhoods. Provide insights on viable investment opportunities and suggested neighborhoods for investment based on the analysis.
